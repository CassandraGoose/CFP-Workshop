**The Busy Developer’s Guide to Go**

http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/speaking-tips-proposals/

> In the mid-2010’s, Google announced a new programming language, Go, and the collective reaction of most of the programming world was a giant yawn. Yet another language, and even though it came from some serious industry veterans–Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike–it didn’t really seem to be bringing all that much that was new or interesting to the table. By 2015, that tune had changed. Go is now one of the “up-and-comers” in the programming language world, and it owes its success to a variety of factors.

> In this presentation, we’re going to take a hard look at the language, go over what it has (and what it lacks!), what makes it interesting, and get comfortable with some of the syntax basics, as a “first steps” towards building non-trivial Go programs in the future. It’s probably not the last programming language you’ll ever learn, but it is definitely one of the few that you should learn.


**The UX of AI**

https://conveyux.com/sessions/the-ux-for-ai/

> The application of Artificial Intelligence is still in its infancy. A recent report noted that up to 70% of companies are not doing much with AI & Machine Learning (ML). Adding to this, we have heard time and again from customers that there is still a lot of confusion about how AI and ML can be applied in a way that elevates the human-computer interaction.

> In this talk, we will explore how designers, researchers, and product managers can incorporate AI-thinking into their projects. Using insights gathered from enterprise customer research, and lessons learned working with cross-functional stakeholders, attendees will learn about valuable tools, methods, and best practices when developing intelligent digital experiences.
Using the case study method, Jennifer & Capri will share recent examples that explore Enterprise and Consumer use cases that will prompt the audience to explore how AI & ML might impact existing constructs for UX practice.
